# UNIGE Year 2 Presentation

To build, `make` (requires `latexmk`, and LaTeX obviously).

Notes are for [pdfpc](https://pdfpc.github.io/); no notes for the short form because it's not really worth it. The short form is the 15 min annual presentation at UNIGE, and the long form the background and proposal presentation with Igor and Andrea.
